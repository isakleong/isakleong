Hi ðŸ‘‹,

My Name is Isak Imanuel Leong, studied Informatics Engineering and graduated from Petra Christian University (PCU '16).

I'm currently a software engineer in the Sales Force Automation (SFA) Department at PT. Tirtakencana Tatawarna (Member of [Avian Brands](https://avianbrands.com/) ).

I'm passionate about software development, especially in mobile application development.

I'm currently in love with hybrid app development using Flutter as my current favorite framework.
